Ocean.</div><div id="2" name="2"> It is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.</div><div id="3" name="3"> Due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as l’Hexagone ("The Hexagon").</div><div id="4" name="4"><br/><br/></div><div id="5" name="5">By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the third-largest in Europe as a whole.</div><div id="6" name="6"> With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU.</div><div id="7" name="7"> France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center.</div><div id="8" name="8"> The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people.</div><div id="9" name="9"> The nation's ideals are expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.</div><div id="10" name="10"><br/><br/></div><div id="11" name="11">France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world.</div><div id="12" name="12"> Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture.</div><div id="13" name="13"> It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.</div><div id="14"

name="16"> It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps.</div><div id="17" name="17"> Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world.</div><div id="18" name="18"> France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity.</div><div id="19" name="19"> In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.</div><div id="20" name="20"><br/><br/></div><div id="21" name="21">French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development.</div><div id="22" name="22"> France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.</div><div id="23" name="23"> It is a member of numerous international institutions, including Francophonie, the G8, G20, NATO, OECD, WTO, and the Latin Union.</div><div id="24" name="24"> France is a founding and leading member state of the European Union.</div><div id="25" name="25"><br/><br/></div><div id="26" name="26">Etymology<br/><br/></div><div id="27" name="27">The name "France" comes from the Latin Francia, which means "country of the Franks".</div><div id="28" name="28"> There are various theories as to the origin of the name Franks: one is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.</div><div id="29" name="29"> Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave.</div><div id="30" name="30"><br/><br/></div><div id="31" name="31">According to Czech historian, David Solomon Ganz, the country takes its name from Franci (Francio), one of the Germanic kings of Sicambri in circa 61 BCE, and whose dominion extended all along those lands immediately joining the west-bank of the Rhine River, as far as Strasbourg and Belgium.</div><div id="32" name="32"> This nation is explicitly mentioned by Julius Caesar in his Notebooks on the Gallic War (Commentarii de Bello Gallico), as is Francio in the Chronicle of Fredegar.</div><div id="33" name="33"><br/><br/></div><div id="34" name="34">History<br/><br/></div><div id="35" name="35">The oldest traces of human life (homo) in what is now France date from approximately 1.</div><div id="36" name="36">8 million years ago.</div><div id="37" name="37"> Humans were then confronted by a hard and variable climate, marked by several glacial eras which led them to a nomadic hunter-gatherer life.</div><div id="38" name="38"> France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Paleolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved: Lascaux (approximately 18,000 BC).</div><div id="39" name="39"><br/><br/></div><div id="40" name="40">At the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate softened and from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary.</div><div id="41" name="41"> After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, and later iron.</div><div id="42" name="42"> France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).</div><div id="43" name="43"><br/><br/></div><div id="44" name="44">In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks, originating from Phocaea, founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</div><div id="45" name="45"> This makes it France's oldest city.</div><div id="46" name="46"> At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of France, and this occupation spread to the rest of France between the 5th and 3rd century BC.</div><div id="47" name="47"><br/><br/></div><div id="48" name="48">The concept of Gaul emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean.</div><div id="49" name="49"> The borders of modern France are roughly the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls.</div><div id="50" name="50"> Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman influences.</div><div id="51" name="51"> However, around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.</div><div id="52" name="52"> The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC, when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.</div><div id="53" name="53"> But the Romans and the Gauls would maintain an adversarial relationship for the next several centuries and the Gauls would remain a threat in Italia.</div><div id="54" name="54"><br/><br/></div><div id="55" name="55">Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Romana ("Roman Province"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.</div><div id="56" name="56"> Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.</div><div id="57" name="57"> Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.</div><div id="58" name="58"> Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered to be the capital of the Gauls.</div><div id="59" name="59"> These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths.</div><div id="60" name="60"> The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved) and Roman culture.</div><div id="61" name="61"> The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism.</div><div id="62" name="62"><br/><br/></div><div id="63" name="63">From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its "limes" or fortified borders protecting the Empire being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.</div><div id="64" name="64"> Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.</div><div id="65" name="65"> In 312, the emperor Constantin I converted to Christianity.</div><div id="66" name="66"> Christians, persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.</div><div id="67" name="67"> But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed, and Germanic tribes, such as the Vandals, Suebi and Alans crossed the Rhine and settled in Gaul, Spain and other parts of the collapsing Roman Empire.</div><div id="68" name="68"><br/><br/></div><div id="69" name="69">At the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius (West).</div><div id="70" name="70"> Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica.</div><div id="71" name="71"> As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region.</div><div id="72" name="72"><br/><br/></div><div id="73" name="73">The pagan Franks, from whom the ancient name of "Francie" was derived, originally settled the north part of Gaul, but under Clovis I conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central Gaul.</div><div id="74" name="74"> In 498, Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" (French: La fille aînée de l’Église) by the papacy, and French kings would be called "the Most Christian Kings of France" (Rex Christianissimus).</div><div id="75" name="75"><br/><br/></div><div id="76" name="76">The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia ("Land of the Franks").</div><div id="77" name="77"> The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in north Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged.</div><div id="78" name="78"> Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death.</div><div id="79" name="79"> The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims.</div><div id="80" name="80"><br/><br/></div><div id="81" name="81">The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household).</div><div id="82" name="82"> One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms.</div><div id="83" name="83"> His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty.</div><div id="84" name="84"> Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.</div><div id="85" name="85"><br/><br/></div><div id="86" name="86">Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church, Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur.</div><div id="87" name="87"><br/><br/></div><div id="88" name="88">Charlemagne's son, Louis I (emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death.</div><div id="89" name="89"> In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald.</div><div id="90" name="90"> West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor, to modern France.</div><div id="91" name="91"><br/><br/></div><div id="92" name="92">During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen.</div><div id="93" name="93"> Thus was established feudalism in France.</div><div id="94" name="94"> Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king.</div><div id="95" name="95"> For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France.</div><div id="96" name="96"><br/><br/></div><div id="97" name="97">The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.</div><div id="98" name="98"> His descendants – the Capetians, the House of Valois, and the House of Bourbon – progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II Augustus.</div><div id="99" name="99"> Gerbert d'Aurillac (Gerbert of Aurillac) was the first French pope; his reign as Pope Sylvester II lasted from 999 to 1003.</div><div id="100" name="100"><br/><br/></div><div id="101" name="101">The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the south-western area of modern-day France.</div><div id="102" name="102"> In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of France.</div><div id="103" name="103"> Later Kings expanded their territory to cover over half of modern continental France, including most of the North, Centre and West of France.</div><div id="104" name="104"> Meanwhile, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred around a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.</div><div id="105" name="105"><br/><br/></div><div id="106" name="106">Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.</div><div id="107" name="107"> Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.</div><div id="108" name="108"> Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, a cousin of Charles, rather than through the female line to Charles' nephew, Edward, who would soon become Edward III of England.</div><div id="109" name="109"> During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.</div><div id="110" name="110"><br/><br/></div><div id="111" name="111">However, Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England and in 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.</div><div id="112" name="112"> The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but French landholdings of the English Kings remained extensive for decades.</div><div id="113" name="113"><br/><br/></div><div id="114" name="114">With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back English continental territories.</div><div id="115" name="115"> Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.</div><div id="116" name="116"><br/><br/></div><div id="117" name="117">The French Renaissance saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between the Kingdom of France and the powerful Holy Roman Empire.</div><div id="118" name="118"> It also saw the first standardization of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy.</div><div id="119" name="119"> French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire.</div><div id="120" name="120"><br/><br/></div><div id="121" name="121">The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St.</div><div id="122" name="122"> Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.</div><div id="123" name="123"> The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots.</div><div id="124" name="124"><br/><br/></div><div id="125" name="125">Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu reinforced the centralization of the state, royal power and French dominance in Europe, foreshadowing the reign of Louis XIV.</div><div id="126" name="126"> During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France, which was at that time at war with Spain.</div><div id="127" name="127"> This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in France.</div><div id="128" name="128"><br/><br/></div><div id="129" name="129">The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV.</div><div id="130" name="130"> By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged.</div><div id="131" name="131"> Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power.</div><div id="132" name="132"> France possessed the largest population in Europe (see Demographics of France) and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture.</div><div id="133" name="133"> French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.</div><div id="134" name="134"> France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia.</div><div id="135" name="135"> Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile.</div><div id="136" name="136"><br/><br/></div><div id="137" name="137">Under Louis XV, France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War, which ended in 1763.</div><div id="138" name="138"> Its continental territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770).</div><div id="139" name="139"> An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions, and his debauchery discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the French Revolution 15 years after his death.</div><div id="140" name="140"><br/><br/></div><div id="141" name="141">Louis XVI, Louis XV's grandson, actively supported the Americans, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain (realized in the Treaty of Paris (1783)).</div><div id="142" name="142"> The example of the American Revolution and the financial crisis which followed France's involvement in it were two of many contributing factors to the French Revolution.</div><div id="143" name="143"><br/><br/></div><div id="144" name="144">Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists.</div><div id="145" name="145"> French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe.</div><div id="146" name="146"> The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the French Revolution.</div><div id="147" name="147"><br/><br/></div><div id="148" name="148">After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, the absolute monarchy was abolished and France became a constitutional monarchy.</div><div id="149" name="149"> Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, France established fundamental rights for French citizens (who could only be male).</div><div id="150" name="150"> The Declaration affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" to "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression".</div><div id="151" name="151"> It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.</div><div id="152" name="152"><br/><br/></div><div id="153" name="153">The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process.</div><div id="154" name="154"> Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed.</div><div id="155" name="155"> The Declaration also asserted the principles of popular sovereignty, in contrast to the divine right of kings that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, eliminating the privileges of the nobility and clergy.</div><div id="156" name="156"><br/><br/></div><div id="157" name="157">While Louis XVI, as a constitutional king, enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion.</div><div id="158" name="158"> His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.</div><div id="159" name="159"><br/><br/></div><div id="160" name="160">European monarchies gathered against the new régime, to restore the French absolute monarchy.</div><div id="161" name="161"> The foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil and deepened the sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against Austria on 20 April 1792.</div><div id="162" name="162"> Mob violence occurred during the insurrection of 10 August 1792 and the following month.</div><div id="163" name="163"> As a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, the Republic was proclaimed on 22 September 1792.</div><div id="164" name="164"><br/><br/></div><div id="165" name="165">Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793.</div><div id="166" name="166"> Facing increasing pressure from European monarchies, internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions (such as the War in the Vendée or the Chouannerie), the young Republic fell into the Reign of Terror.</div><div id="167" name="167"> Between 1793 and 1794, between 16,000 and 40,000 people were executed.</div><div id="168" name="168"> In Western France, the civil war between the Bleus ("Blues", supporters of the Revolution) and the Blancs ("Whites", supporters of the Monarchy) lasted from 1793 to 1796 and led to the loss of between 200,000 and 450,000 lives.</div><div id="169" name="169"><br/><br/></div><div id="170" name="170">Both foreign armies and French counterrevolutionnaries were crushed and the French Republic survived.</div><div id="171" name="171"> Furthermore, it extended greatly its boundaries and established "Sister Republics" in the surrounding countries.</div><div id="172" name="172"> As the threat of a foreign invasion receded and France became mostly pacified, the Thermidorian Reaction put an end to Robespierre's rule and to the Terror.</div><div id="173" name="173"> The abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage, enacted during this radical phase of the revolution, were cancelled by subsequent governments.</div><div id="174" name="174"><br/><br/></div><div id="175" name="175">After a short-lived governmental scheme, Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814/1815).</div><div id="176" name="176"> As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire.</div><div id="177" name="177"> His armies conquered most of continental Europe, while members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.</div><div id="178" name="178"><br/><br/></div><div id="179" name="179">These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the Metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man.</div><div id="180" name="180"> After the catastrophic Russian campaign, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored.</div><div id="181" name="181"> About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.</div><div id="182" name="182"><br/><br/></div><div id="183" name="183">After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations.</div><div id="184" name="184"> The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy, which lasted until 1848, when the French Second Republic was proclaimed, in the wake of the European Revolutions of 1848.</div><div id="185" name="185"> The abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage, both briefly enacted during the French Revolution were re-enacted in 1848.</div><div id="186" name="186"><br/><br/></div><div id="187" name="187">In 1852, the

climate in the rest of Metropolitan France.</div><div id="245" name="245"> Most of France in the south has a Mediterranean climate that prevails.</div><div id="246" name="246"> In the west, the climate is predominantly oceanic with a high level of rainfall, mild winters and warm summers.</div><div id="247" name="247"> Inland the climate becomes more continental with hot, stormy summers, colder winters and less rain.</div><div id="248" name="248"> The climate of the Alps and other mountainous regions is mainly alpine, with the number of days with temperatures below freezing over 150

1971.</div><div id="251" name="251"> Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia.</div><div id="252" name="252"> This is due to France's decision to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis, which now accounts for 75% of its electricity production and results in less pollution.</div><div id="253" name="253"><br/><br/></div><div id="254" name="254">Like all European Union members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020, compared to the U.</div><div id="255" name="255">S.</div><div id="256" name="256"> plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.</div><div id="257" name="257"> As of 2009, French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.</div><div id="258" name="258"> The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 Euros per tonne of carbon emitted, which would have raised 4 billion Euros of revenue annually.</div><div id="259" name="259"> However, the plan abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.</div><div id="260"

divisions<br/><br/></div><div id="267" name="267">France is divided into 27 administrative regions, 22 in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica), and five located overseas.</div><div id="268" name="268"> The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments, which are numbered mainly alphabetically.</div><div id="269" name="269"> This number is used in postal codes and vehicle number plates amongst others.</div><div id="270" name="270"><br/><br/></div><div id="271" name="271">The 101 departments are subdivided into 341 arrondissements which are, in turn, subdivided into 4,051 cantons.</div><div id="272" name="272"> These cantons are then divided into 36,697 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.</div><div id="273" name="273"> There are 2,588 intercommunal entities grouping 33,414 of the 36,697 communes (i.</div><div id="274" name="274">e.</div><div id="275" name="275"> 91.</div><div id="276" name="276">1% of all the communes).</div><div id="277" name="277"> Three communes, Paris, Lyon and Marseille are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.</div><div id="278" name="278"><br/><br/></div><div id="279" name="279">The regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive.</div><div id="280" name="280"> Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions.</div><div id="281" name="281"> However, this was not always the case.</div><div id="282" name="282"> Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946.</div><div id="283" name="283"><br/><br/></div><div id="284" name="284">Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs) and are an integral part of France (and the European Union) and thus enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments.</div><div id="285" name="285"><br/><br/></div><div id="286" name="286">In addition to the 27 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island).</div><div id="287" name="287"><br/><br/></div><div id="288" name="288">Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St.</div><div id="289" name="289"> Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007).</div><div id="290" name="290"> The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Fortuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro.</div><div id="291" name="291"> In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.</div><div id="292" name="292"><br/><br/></div><div id="293" name="293">Governance<br/><br/></div><div id="294" name="294">The French Republic is a unitary semi-presidential republic with strong democratic traditions.</div><div id="295" name="295"> The constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958.</div><div id="296" name="296"> It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament.</div><div id="297" name="297"> The executive branch itself has two leaders: the President of the Republic, currently François Hollande, who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years), and the Government, led by the president-appointed Prime Minister, currently Manuel Valls.</div><div id="298" name="298"><br/><br/></div><div id="299" name="299">The French parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) and a Senate.</div><div id="300" name="300"> The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.</div><div id="301" name="301"> The Assembly has the power to dismiss the cabinet, and thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government.</div><div id="302" name="302"> Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms), and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in September 2008.</div><div id="303" name="303"><br/><br/></div><div id="304" name="304">The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.</div><div id="305" name="305"> The government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament.</div><div id="306" name="306"><br/><br/></div><div id="307" name="307">French politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred around the French Socialist Party, and the other right-wing, centred previously around the Rassemblement pour la République (RPR) and now its successor the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).</div><div id="308" name="308"> Since the 2012 elections, the executive branch is currently composed mostly of the Socialist Party.</div><div id="309" name="309"><br/><br/></div><div id="310" name="310">France uses a civil legal system; that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law).</div><div id="311" name="311"> Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV).</div><div id="312" name="312"> In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society.</div><div id="313" name="313"> As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.</div><div id="314" name="314"> That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.</div><div id="315" name="315"><br/><br/></div><div id="316" name="316">French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law.</div><div id="317" name="317"> Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law.</div><div id="318" name="318"> Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law.</div><div id="319" name="319"> However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law.</div><div id="320" name="320"> Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).</div><div id="321" name="321"> While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State.</div><div id="322" name="322"><br/><br/></div><div id="323" name="323">To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française.</div><div id="324" name="324"><br/><br/></div><div id="325" name="325">France does not recognize religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions.</div><div id="326" name="326"> France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791).</div><div id="327" name="327"> However, "offenses against public decency" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.</div><div id="328" name="328"> Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.</div><div id="329" name="329"> Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.</div><div id="330" name="330"> France has laws against racism and antisemitism.</div><div id="331" name="331"><br/><br/></div><div id="332" name="332">France's attitude towards freedom of religion is complex.</div><div id="333" name="333"> Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</div><div id="334" name="334"> However, since the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the State tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the French society: the Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004.</div><div id="335" name="335"> In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public.</div><div id="336" name="336"> As some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus, and after criticism by human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, these laws remain controversial, although they are supported by most of the population.</div><div id="337" name="337"><br/><br/></div><div id="338" name="338">France is tolerant of the LGBT community.</div><div id="339" name="339"> Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since May 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal in France.</div><div id="340" name="340"><br/><br/></div><div id="341" name="341">France is a member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.</div><div id="342" name="342"> It is also a member of the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).</div><div id="343" name="343"> It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of fifty-one fully or partly French-speaking countries.</div><div id="344" name="344"><br/><br/></div><div id="345" name="345">As a significant hub for international relations, France hosts the second largest assembly of diplomatic missions in the world and the headquarters of international organizations including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and la Francophonie.</div><div id="346" name="346"><br/><br/></div><div id="347" name="347">Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member.</div><div id="348" name="348"> Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.</div><div id="349" name="349"> In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process, seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe.</div><div id="350" name="350"> However, since 1904, France has maintained an "Entente cordiale" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.</div><div id="351" name="351"><br/><br/></div><div id="352" name="352">France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the special relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies.</div><div id="353" name="353"> France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, straining bilateral relations with the US and the UK.</div><div id="354" name="354"> However, as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy's pro-American politics (much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right), France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.</div><div id="355" name="355"><br/><br/></div><div id="356" name="356">In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia.</div><div id="357" name="357"><br/><br/></div><div id="358" name="358">France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique) and has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.</div><div id="359" name="359"> Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control.</div><div id="360" name="360"><br/><br/></div><div id="361" name="361">In 2009, France was the second largest (in absolute numbers) donor of development aid in the world, behind the US, and ahead of Germany, Japan and the UK.</div><div id="362" name="362"> This represents 0.</div><div id="363" name="363">5% of its GDP, in this regard rating France as tenth largest donor on the list.</div><div id="364" name="364"> The organisation managing the French help is the French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa.</div><div id="365" name="365"> The main goals of this help are "developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy.</div><div id="366" name="366">"<br/><br/></div><div id="367" name="367">The French Armed Forces (Armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the president as supreme commander.</div><div id="368" name="368"> They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale), the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and the auxiliary paramilitary force, the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) and are among the largest armed forces in the world.</div><div id="369" name="369"> While administratively a part of the French armed forces, and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of Defence, the Gendarmerie is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior.</div><div id="370" name="370"><br/><br/></div><div id="371" name="371">The gendarmerie is a military police force which serves for the most part as a rural and general purpose police force.</div><div id="372" name="372"> It encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale) and the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale).</div><div id="373" name="373"> One of the

ballistic missiles.</div><div id="385" name="385"> In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads, of which around 50 are deployed by the Air Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.</div><div id="386" name="386"> The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear

Latin, Aquitanian, and Germanic (Frankish, Alemannic, Viking) origin, they are today a mixture of several other ethnic groups, due mostly to large-scale immigration over the last century and a half.</div><div id="532" name="532"><br/><br/></div><div id="533" name="533">In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the

the US as a major power.</div><div id="577" name="577"> Ironically, for most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a

Alsatian, Breton or Occitan.</div><div id="578" name="578"> Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased

Africa.</div><div id="582" name="582"> The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (South-east Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia).</div><div id="583" name="583"> On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.</div><div id="584" name="584"><br/><br/></div><div id="585"

has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was.</div><div id="591" name="591"> Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.</div><div id="592" name="592"> Whilst in 1965, 81% of the French declared themselves to be Catholics, in 2009 this proportion was 64%.</div><div id="593" name="593"> Moreover, whilst 27% of the French went to Mass once a week or more in 1952, only 5% did so in 2006.</div><div id="594" name="594"> The same survey found that Protestants accounted for 3% of the population, an increase from previous surveys, and 5% adhered to other religions, with the remaining 28% stating they had no religion.</div><div id="595" name="595"> Evangelical Christianity may be the fastest growing religion in France.</div><div id="596" name="596"><br/><br/></div><div id="597" name="597">The French Revolution saw a radical shift in the status of the Catholic Church with the launch of a brutal campaign of de-Christianization.</div><div id="598" name="598"> After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments over the 19th century, laïcité was established with the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State.</div><div id="599" name="599"><br/><br/></div><div id="600" name="600">According to a poll in January 2007, only 5% of the French population attended church regularly (10% attend church services regularly among the respondents who did identify themselves as Catholics).</div><div id="601" name="601"> The poll showed 51% identified as being Catholics, 31% identified as being agnostics or atheists (another poll sets the proportion of atheists equal to 27%), 10% identified as being from other religions or being without opinion, 4% identified as Muslim, 3% identified as Protestant, 1% identified as Buddhist, 1% identified as Jewish.</div><div id="602" name="602"> Meanwhile, an independent estimate by the politologist Pierre Bréchon in 2009 concluded that the proportion of Catholics had fallen to 42% while the number of atheists and agnostics had risen to 50%.</div><div id="603"

total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).</div><div id="606" name="606"> According to the Pewforum, "In France, proponents of a 2004 law banning the wearing of religious symbols in schools say it protects Muslim girls from being forced to wear a headscarf, but the law also restricts those who want to wear headscarves – or any other “conspicuous” religious symbol, including large Christian crosses and Sikh turbans – as an expression of their faith"<br/><br/></div><div id="607" name="607">The current Jewish community in France numbers around 600,000 according to the World Jewish Congress and is the largest in Europe.</div><div id="608" name="608"><br/><br/></div><div id="609" name="609">Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of laïcité, in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle).</div><div id="610" name="610"> Instead, it merely recognises religious organisations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine.</div><div id="611" name="611"> Conversely, religious organizations should refrain from intervening in policy-making.</div><div id="612" name="612"> Certain bodies of beliefs such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults ("sectes" in French), and therefore do not have the same status as religions in France.</div><div id="613" name="613"> Secte

have the reputation of being one of the thinnest peoples in developed countries,  France—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food in French eating habits.</div><div id="624" name="624"> Nevertheless, the French obesity rate is far below that of the USA (for instance, obesity rate in France is the same that the American once was in the 1970s), and is still the lowest of Europe, but it is now regarded by the authorities as one of the main public health issues and is fiercely fought; rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.</div><div id="625" name="625"><br/><br/></div><div id="626" name="626">In 1802, Napoleon created the lycée.</div><div id="627" name="627"> Nevertheless it is Jules Ferry who is considered to be the father of the French modern school, which is free, secular, and compulsory until the age of 13

coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks France's education as the 25th best in the world, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.</div><div id="631" name="631"> Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education.</div><div id="632" name="632"><br/><br/></div><div id="633" name="633">Higher education in France is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Science Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produces high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the great corps of the State.</div><div id="634" name="634"> The Grandes

cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public.</div><div id="641" name="641"> The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments.</div><div id="642" name="642"> The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.</div><div id="643" name="643"><br/><br/></div><div id="644" name="644">France receives the highest number of tourists per year,

people annually.</div><div id="646" name="646"> The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.</div><div id="647" name="647"><br/><br/></div><div id="648" name="648">The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly

influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance.</div><div id="653" name="653"> Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand.</div><div id="654" name="654"> The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France.</div><div id="655" name="655"> Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy.</div><div id="656" name="656"><br/><br/></div><div id="657" name="657">The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualized itself through classicism.</div><div id="658" name="658"> Louis XIV's prime minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists.</div><div id="659" name="659"><br/><br/></div><div id="660" name="660">French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country.</div><div id="661" name="661"> The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism.</div><div id="662" name="662"> At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, and Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism.</div><div id="663" name="663"><br/><br/></div><div id="664" name="664">In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism.</div><div id="665" name="665"> The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.</div><div id="666" name="666"> The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions, as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.</div><div id="667" name="667"><br/><br/></div><div id="668" name="668">At the beginning of 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris.</div><div id="669"

name="670"><br/><br/></div><div id="671" name="671">Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works.</div><div id="672" name="672"> A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as Mona Lisa, also known as La Joconde.</div><div id="673" name="673"> While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganization of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).</div><div id="674" name="674"><br/><br/></div><div id="675" name="675">Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou.</div><div id="676" name="676"> These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year.</div><div id="677" name="677"> Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.</div><div id="678" name="678">3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.</div><div id="679" name="679">8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.</div><div id="680"

fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers.</div><div id="685" name="685"> Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles.</div><div id="686" name="686"> During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.</div><div id="687" name="687"> Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe, and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey.</div><div id="688" name="688"><br/><br/></div><div id="689" name="689">The Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning « French work », was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.</div><div id="690" name="690"> Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens.</div><div id="691" name="691"> The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.</div><div id="692" name="692"> Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon.</div><div id="693" name="693"><br/><br/></div><div id="694" name="694">The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture.</div><div id="695" name="695"> It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley.</div><div id="696" name="696"> Such residential castles were the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.</div><div id="697" name="697"><br/><br/></div><div id="698" name="698">Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style.</div><div id="699" name="699"> However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.</div><div id="700" name="700"> In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features.</div><div id="701" name="701"> Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.</div><div id="702" name="702"> Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy.</div><div id="703" name="703"> On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.</div><div id="704" name="704"><br/><br/></div><div id="705" name="705">After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such building as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse.</div><div id="706" name="706"> Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.</div><div id="707" name="707"><br/><br/></div><div id="708" name="708">Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built.</div><div id="709" name="709"> The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris.</div><div id="710" name="710"> The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire.</div><div id="711" name="711"> At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.</div><div id="712" name="712"> In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower.</div><div id="713" name="713"><br/><br/></div><div id="714" name="714">In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France.</div><div id="715" name="715"> More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles.</div><div id="716" name="716"> The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building.</div><div id="717" name="717"> The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar.</div><div id="718" name="718"> For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters, or 121 feet.</div><div id="719" name="719"> France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.</div><div id="720" name="720"> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct.</div><div id="721" name="721"> Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu.</div><div id="722" name="722"><br/><br/></div><div id="723" name="723">The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language.</div><div id="724" name="724"> There were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar.</div><div id="725" name="725"> Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail.</div><div id="726" name="726"> Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX

the Grasshopper.</div><div id="739" name="739"> Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people.</div><div id="740"

name="746"><br/><br/></div><div id="747" name="747">French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries.</div><div id="748" name="748"> Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew.</div><div id="749" name="749"> He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and obscurantism.</div><div id="750" name="750"> During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard.</div><div id="751" name="751"> At the start of the
